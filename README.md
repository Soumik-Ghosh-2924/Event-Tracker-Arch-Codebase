# 🚀 Event Tracker Architecture – Monorepo

This repository contains the full **Event Tracking System** architecture, implemented as a **monorepo**.  
It brings together:

- 🎨 **React UI** (`react-ui/`) – A frontend for user interactions.  
- ⚡ **Producer Service** (`producer-service/`) – A Spring Boot microservice publishing events to Kafka.  
- 📥 **Consumer Service** (`consumer-service/`) – A Spring Boot microservice consuming events from Kafka and persisting them into a database.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```text
   [ React UI ] ---> [ Producer Service ] ---> [ Kafka Topic ] ---> [ Consumer Service ] ---> [ Database ]
````

* **React UI** triggers events (user actions).
* **Producer Service** publishes events into Kafka.
* **Kafka** acts as a distributed event broker.
* **Consumer Service** listens to Kafka, processes events, and stores them in the DB.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Event-Tracker-Arch-Codebase.git
cd Event-Tracker-Arch-Codebase
```

### 2️⃣ Run React UI

```bash
cd react-ui
npm install
npm start
```

---

### 3️⃣ Run Producer Service

```bash
cd producer-service
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Service runs on 👉 `http://localhost:9096`

---

### 4️⃣ Run Consumer Service

```bash
cd consumer-service
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Consumes from Kafka and persists to DB.

Consumer runs on 👉 `http://localhost:9091`

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React + Vite
* **Backend Services:** Spring Boot (Producer & Consumer)
* **Messaging:** Apache Kafka
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (default in consumer-service)

---

## 🎯 Features

* Event-driven microservices with Kafka.
* Monorepo for easy collaboration and CI/CD.
